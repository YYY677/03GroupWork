## 🧠 Project Motivation

* To fulfill the CASA0003 Mini Project assessment with a strong emphasis on team-based geovisualisation and storytelling.
* To integrate multiple urban datasets and deliver insights into housing, transport, safety, amenities, and community features.

## 📌 What Does the Visualisation Show?

This project visualizes key dimensions of urban livability in London. By integrating spatial and statistical data, it aims to help users identify **ideal places to live** based on personal priorities, such as:

* 🏠 Housing affordability
* 🚇 Transport accessibility
* 🛡️ Safety and crime levels
* 🏪 Convenience and local amenities
* 🗺️ General borough awareness and layout

We provide **an interactive experience** through city maps, data layers, and embedded analytics, helping users make **informed and confident housing decisions**.

## 💡 Design & Technical Approach

### Design Strategy

* A **long-scroll storytelling format** with clearly defined themed sections.
* Embedded maps via `<iframe>` to modularize development and maintenance.
* A clean, modern UI with Bootstrap for layout and responsiveness.
* Focus on interactivity and accessibility for both desktop and mobile users.

### Technologies Used

* **HTML5 & CSS3** — Page structure and styling
* **JavaScript (Vanilla + libraries)** — Data handling and DOM interactivity
* **Mapbox GL JS** — Interactive map rendering and layer control
* **Turf.js** — Geospatial calculations (e.g., buffer, distance)
* **ECharts** — Custom charts and visual analysis
* **Bootstrap** — Responsive layout and UI components
* **GitHub Pages** — Project hosting and deployment
